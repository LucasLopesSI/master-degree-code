MX-PA05004082-A	The present invention concerns a device that makes it possible to lock and unlock, by means of a key, a stopper or cover on a frame. The device is characterized in that the rotor of the lock comprises a cylindrical barrel (17) mounted with rotation in the stopper (1) and being interdependent in rotation in the slide bolt (1) ans a cylindrical axle (18) with head (21) mounted loosely in the barrel (17). The invention is used in the area of road works..	null	[E02D29/14]	[]	[]	[]	null	null	engineering	chemistry
MX-PA00012441-A	The invention relates to a method of monitoring the diameter of columns made in the ground by jet grouting. In the method, a measuring instrument (14) is provided which is constituted by a tubular element (16) of length substantially equal to the length of the column (2), said tubular element being fitted with a plurality of emission electrodes (18) for creating an electric field, and with a plurality of measurement electrodes (18) for measuring the resulting potential differences; a reference borehole is made in the ground; an axial borehole (36) is made in the column (32) to be tested; said measuring instrument (16) is inserted in the borehole in said column and voltage measurements are performed at different depths; and said measurements are processed.	null	[G01B5/08]	[]	[]	[]	null	null	physics	engineering
MX-337692-B	Absorbent members and methods of making the same are disclosed. In one embodiment, the absorbent member is a unitary absorbent fibrous web having a density profile through its thickness. In one embodiment, the density profile is relatively centered through the thickness of the web and the maximum density of the web is located between about 35% and about 65% of the distance through the thickness of the web. In one embodiment, the method involves subjecting a precursor web to at least one cycle (or pass) through a mechanical deformation process. Typically, the method involves subjecting the precursor web to multiples cycles (or passes) through a mechanical deformation process.	null	[D04H1/26]	[]	[]	[]	null	null	chemistry	engineering
MX-358542-B	The present invention relates to a topical pharmaceutical composition comprising the combination of methotrexate, alpha-bisabolol and allantoin; to the method for producing same and to the use of the composition for treating plaque psoriasis (common psoriasis), atopic dermatitis and chronic eczema. The composition according to the present invention can be used in isolation or in association with other systemic or topical therapies. The present invention also describes a process for producing the pharmaceutical composition.	null	[A61K31/045]	[]	[]	[]	null	null	clinical and experimental medicine	biology (organismic & supraorganismic level)
MX-367233-B	The invention relates to novel formulation additives of formula 1 and to the production and use thereof, in particular as adjuvants and additives for agrochemical formulations. A novel combination of known ether sulfates and cations allows products with superior characteristics to be obtained, such as pesticides with improved strength.	null	[C09K23/02]	[]	[]	[]	null	null	chemistry	biology (organismic & supraorganismic level)
